              <b>Beeturia</b> is the discoloration of urine following the consumption of 
              beets or foods colored with beetroot.[1] The typical color can range from pink to deep red, 
              and this phenomenon is prevalent in 10%-14% of the population, with increased frequency noted 
              those who are iron deficient or afflicted with malabsorptive diseases. [2] The pigments found in the 
              beet and beetroot are a family of betacyanins, and following isolation of these compounds, 
              the technically correct clinical term for the discoloration of urine was betacyaniuria. 
              Initially, the thinking was that findings of beeturia were due to food allergies or colonization of 
              the urinary tract with bacteria, 
              but additional studies clarified that these were faulty theories

              Carotenoids are tetraterpene pigments that are distributed in photosynthetic bacteria, 
              some species of archaea and fungi, algae, plants, and animals. About 850 naturally occurring 
              carotenoids had been reported up until 2018. Photosynthetic bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants can 
              synthesize carotenoids de novo. Carotenoids are essential pigments in photosynthetic organs along with 
              chlorophylls. Carotenoids also act as photo-protectors, antioxidants, color attractants, and 
              precursors of plant hormones in non-photosynthetic organs of plants. Animals cannot synthesize carotenoids 
              de novo, and so those found in animals are either directly accumulated from food or partly modified through 
              metabolic reactions. So, animal carotenoids show structural diversity. Carotenoids in animals play important 
              roles such precursors of vitamin A, photo-protectors, antioxidants, enhancers of immunity, and contributors to 
              reproduction. In the present review, 
              I describe the structural diversity, function, biosyntheses, and metabolism of natural carotenoids.
